# My Custom Go Learning Path

## Acknowledgements

These learning paths are inspired by the Roadmap [Go Learning Path](https://roadmap.sh/golang).

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- Basic knowledge of Git
- Basic knowledge of GitHub and repository cloning.
- Basic knowledge of how to install Go and Go dependencies
- Familiarity with setting environment variables (for GOPATH, GOROOT)
- Understanding of basic code editor/IDE usage
- Basic understanding of package management concepts

## Learning Path

This repository outlines the custom learning path I'm taking to master the Go programming language. It's designed as a year-long journey divided into two stages:

[Beginner to Intermediate:](docs/beginner.md) Click here to see the beginner to intermediate learning path.

- Go syntax and fundamental concepts (variables, data types, control flow)
- Functions, methods, and basic data structures
- Working with files, strings, and arrays
- Introduction to APIs and web services
- Implementing and using custom data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hashmaps, trees)
- Basic algorithms and problem-solving
- Modules, packages, and Go tooling
- Concurrency fundamentals (goroutines, channels) 

[Advanced:](docs/advanced.md) Click here to see the advanced learning path.

- Concurrency Patterns in Go: (e.g., worker pools, pipelines, using `context` for cancellation)
- Networking in Go: (sockets, building network applications, implementing protocols)
- Web Frameworks (Gin, Echo): (building web apps and APIs, routing, middleware)
- Dependency Injection (Go Wire): (structuring applications, testability)
- gRPC and Protobuf: (defining services, generating code, building gRPC applications)
- Testing and Profiling: (writing unit tests, using testing tools, profiling applications)
- Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms: (e.g., graphs, trees, heaps, priority queues)
- Cloud-Native Development: (Docker, Kubernetes, serverless)

### Additional Advanced Learning Path Modules

While the core Go learning path is designed to be completed in approximately 12 months, this advanced stage includes **7 optional modules** that can further enhance your skills and take your Go proficiency to the next level. These modules cover topics such as code quality, CI/CD, security, service meshes, observability, infrastructure automation, and embedded systems, adding an estimated **7 additional months** to the learning journey.

## **Why Two Stages?**

This two-stage approach allows for a clear progression from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. It also helps demonstrate how Go projects can evolve in complexity and structure as you gain experience.

## **Package Naming Convention**

You'll notice a unique package naming convention (`mXwY`, where X is the month and Y is the week) in both repositories. This non-idiomatic approach is **intentional** and serves two main purposes:

*   **Educational Emphasis:** It reinforces the week-by-week learning structure.
*   **Progression:** It visually highlights the incremental introduction of Go concepts.

In real-world Go projects, remember to use short, descriptive package names! An excellent example of this is the `net/http` package in the Go standard library.
